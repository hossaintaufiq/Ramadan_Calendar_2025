# Ramadan 2025 Calendar

This is a **Ramadan 2025 Calendar** web application that displays a calendar for the month of Ramadan, showing daily Quranic verses and Duas for each day. The user can click on a date to view a popup with the corresponding verse and Dua.

## Features
- Displays a Ramadan calendar for 2025.
- Provides a Quranic verse for each day.
- Includes a daily Dua for every day of Ramadan.
- Interactive UI with hover effects and popup messages.
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic calendar generation and event handling.

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**

   cd ramadan-calendar
   ```
2. **Open the Project:**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your browser.
   - Ensure `style.css` is in the same directory for proper styling.

## How It Works
